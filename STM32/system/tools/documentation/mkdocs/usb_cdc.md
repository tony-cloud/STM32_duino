## USB: Serial

There are two implementations of Serial communication: UART and USB. 

This page describes the USB based.

Please check the [Menu option](menu_options#automatic-serial) to see which one is selected as `Serial`.

If the [USB menu](menu_options) is set to include Serial, SerialUSB is set as a virtual COM port, and can be used just like a regular UART based.
