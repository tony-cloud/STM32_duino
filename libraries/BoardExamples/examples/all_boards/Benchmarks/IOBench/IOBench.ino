/*  IOBench - a simple benchmark for Arduinos and compatibles.
    Written by Gareth Halfacree <freelance@halfacree.co.uk>

    Principle: perform digitalRead and digitalWrite operations
    to measure the relative performance of Arduino MCUs and
    compatible devices.

    The read benchmark begins by measuring the time, in
    microseconds, it takes to complete a large loop.
    The loop is then repeated with a digitalRead operation,
    and the elapsed time in microseconds minus the time taken
    by the incrementing of the variable is printed to the
    serial port. The benchmark does not require anything to be
    connected to Pin 8.

    The write benchmark is split into two sections: soft and hard.
    The soft write benchmark requires no extra hardware, and
    works the same way as the read benchmark; the hard write
    benchmark loops forever and requires a frequency counter or
    oscilloscope connected to Pin 7 to measure the performance.
    The hard benchmark performs two digitalWrites, one high
    and one low, to toggle the pin; this will give a different
    result than the single-write soft benchmark. When comparing
    boards, always compare soft-to-soft and hard-to-hard; never
    compare soft-to-hard or vice-versa.

    NOTE: IOBench is not about getting the best performance out
    of a given microcontroller; there are much more efficient
    ways to read and write than digitalRead and digitalWrite.
    It simply offers a way to quickly compare the relative
    performance of different microcontrollers when using the two
    most common methods of controlling pins.
